    <title>The Build Lifecycle</title>
    <para>We said earlier that the core of Gradle is a language for dependency based programming. In Gradle terms this
        means that you can define tasks and dependencies between tasks. Gradle guarantees that these tasks are executed
        in the order of their dependencies, and that each task is executed only once. These tasks form a
        <ulink url='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph'>Directed Acyclic Graph</ulink>. There are
        build tools that build up such a dependency graph as they execute their tasks. Gradle builds the complete
        dependency graph <emphasis>before</emphasis> any task is executed. This lies at the heart of Gradle and makes
        many things possible which would not be possible otherwise.
    </para>
    <para>Your build scripts configure this dependency graph. Therefore they are strictly speaking <emphasis>build
        configuration scripts</emphasis>.

        <title>Build phases</title>
        <para>A Gradle build has three distinct phases.

                    <para>Gradle supports single and multi-project builds. During the initialization phase, Gradle
                        determines which projects are going to take part in the build, and creates a
                        <apilink class="org.gradle.api.Project"/> instance for each of these projects.

                        The build scripts of <emphasis>all</emphasis> projects which are part of the build are
                        executed. Gradle 1.4 introduced an <link linkend="feature_lifecycle">incubating</link> opt-in feature called <firstterm>configuration on demand</firstterm>.
                        In this mode, Gradle configures only relevant projects (see <xref linkend="sec:configuration_on_demand"/>).

                        <command>gradle</command> command and the current directory. Gradle then executes each of the
                        selected tasks.

    </section>
    <section id='sec:settings_file'>
        <title>Settings file</title>
        <para>Beside the build script files, Gradle defines a settings file. The settings file is determined by Gradle
            via a naming convention. The default name for this file is <filename>settings.gradle</filename>. Later in
            this chapter we explain how Gradle looks for a settings file.
        </para>
        <para>The settings file is executed during the initialization phase. A multiproject build must have a
            <filename>settings.gradle</filename>
            file in the root project of the multiproject hierarchy. It is required because the
            settings file defines which projects are taking part in the multi-project build (see
            <xref linkend='multi_project_builds'/>). For a single-project build, a settings file is optional.
            Besides defining the included projects, you might need it to add libraries to your build script classpath (see <xref
                    linkend='organizing_build_logic'/>). Let's first do some introspection with a single project
            build:
        </para>
        <sample id="buildlifecycle" dir="userguide/buildlifecycle/basic" title="Single project build">
            <sourcefile file="settings.gradle"/>
            <sourcefile file="build.gradle"/>
            <output args="test"/>
        </sample>
        <para>For a build script, the property access and method calls are delegated to a project object. Similarly
            property access and method calls within the settings file is delegated to a settings object. Look at
            the <apilink class='org.gradle.api.initialization.Settings'/> class in the API documentation for more information.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section id='sec:multi_project_builds'>
        <title>Multi-project builds</title>
        <para>A multi-project build is a build where you build more than one project during a single execution of
            Gradle. You have to declare the projects taking part in the multiproject build in the settings file. There
            is much more to say about multi-project builds in the chapter dedicated to this topic (see <xref
                    linkend='multi_project_builds'/>).
        </para>
        <section id='sub:project_locations'>
            <title>Project locations</title>
            <para>Multi-project builds are always represented by a tree with a single root. Each element in the tree
                represents a project. A project has a path which denotes the position
                of the project in the multi-project build tree. In most cases the project path is consistent with
                the physical location of the project in the file system. However, this behavior is configurable.
                The project tree is created in the <filename>settings.gradle</filename> file.
                By default it is assumed that the location of the settings
                file is also the location of the root project. But you can redefine the location of the root project
                in the settings file.
            </para>

        <section id='sub:building_the_tree'>
            <title>Building the tree</title>
            <para>In the settings file you can use a set of methods to build the project tree. Hierarchical and flat
                physical layouts get special support.
            </para>
            <section>
                <title>Hierarchical layouts</title>
                <sample id="standardLayouts" dir="userguide/multiproject/standardLayouts" title="Hierarchical layout">
                    <sourcefile file="settings.gradle" snippet="hierarchical-layout"/>
                </sample>
                <para>The <literal>include</literal> method takes project paths as arguments.
                    The project path is assumed to be equal to the relative physical file system path.
                    For example, a path 'services:api' is mapped by default to a folder 'services/api'
                    (relative from the project root). You only need to specify the leaves of the tree.
                    This means that the inclusion of the path 'services:hotels:api' will result in creating 3 projects:
                    'services', 'services:hotels' and 'services:hotels:api'.
                </para>

                    <sourcefile file="settings.gradle" snippet="flat-layout"/>
                </sample>
                <para>The <literal>includeFlat</literal> method takes directory names as an argument. These directories
                    need to exist as siblings of the root project directory. The location of these directories
                    are considered as child projects of the root project in the multi-project tree.

            <title>Modifying elements of the project tree</title>
            <para>The multi-project tree created in the settings file is made up of so called <firstterm>project descriptors</firstterm>.
                You can modify these descriptors in the settings file at any time. To access a descriptor you can do:
            </para>

    <section id='sec:initialization'>
        <title>Initialization</title>
        <para>How does Gradle know whether to do a single or multiproject build? If you trigger a multiproject build
            from a directory with a settings file, things are easy. But Gradle also allows you to execute the
            build from within any subproject taking part in the build.
            <footnote>
                <para>Gradle supports partial multiproject builds (see <xref linkend='multi_project_builds'/>).
                </para>
            </footnote>
            If you execute Gradle from within a project with no <filename>settings.gradle</filename> file,
            Gradle looks for a <filename>settings.gradle</filename> file in the following way:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>It looks in a directory called <filename>master</filename> which has the same nesting level
                as the current dir.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>If not found yet, it searches parent directories.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>If not found yet, the build is executed as a single project build.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>If a <filename>settings.gradle</filename> file is found, Gradle checks if the current project is part of the
                    multiproject hierarchy defined in the found <filename>settings.gradle</filename> file. If not, the build is executed as a
                    single project build. Otherwise a multiproject build is executed.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>What is the purpose of this behavior? Gradle needs to determine whether the project you are in is
            a subproject of a multiproject build or not. Of course, if it is a subproject, only the subproject and its
            dependent projects are built, but Gradle needs to create the build configuration for the whole multiproject
            build (see <xref linkend='multi_project_builds'/>). You can use the <option>-u</option>
            command line option to tell Gradle not to look in the parent hierarchy for a <filename>settings.gradle</filename> file. The
            current project is then always built as a single project build. If the current project contains a
            <filename>settings.gradle</filename> file, the <option>-u</option> option has no meaning. Such a build is always executed as:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>a single project build, if the <filename>settings.gradle</filename> file does not define a multiproject hierarchy
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>a multiproject build, if the <filename>settings.gradle</filename> file does define a multiproject hierarchy.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>The automatic search for a <filename>settings.gradle</filename> file only works for multi-project
        builds with a physical hierarchical or flat layout. For a flat layout you must additionally follow the
        naming convention described above (“<literal>master</literal>”). Gradle supports arbitrary physical layouts
        for a multiproject build, but for such arbitrary layouts you need to execute the build from the directory
        where the settings file is located. For information on how to run partial builds from the root see
        <xref linkend='sec:running_partial_build_from_the_root'/>.
        </para>
        <para>
        Gradle creates a Project object for every project taking part in the build.
        For a multi-project build these are the projects specified in the Settings object (plus the root
        project). Each project object has by default a name equal to the name of its top level directory,
        and every project except the root project has a parent project. Any project may have child projects.

        <para>For a single project build, the workflow of the <emphasis>after initialization</emphasis>
            phases are pretty simple. The build script is executed against the project object that was created during
            the initialization phase. Then Gradle looks for tasks with names equal to those passed as command line
            arguments. If these task names exist, they are executed as a separate build in the order you have passed
            them. The configuration and execution for multi-project builds is discussed in <xref linkend='multi_project_builds'/>.

    <section id="build_lifecycle_events">
        <title>Responding to the lifecycle in the build script</title>

        <para>Your build script can receive notifications as the build progresses through its lifecycle. These
            notifications generally take two forms: You can either implement a particular listener interface, or you can
            provide a closure to execute when the notification is fired. The examples below use closures. For details on
            how to use the listener interfaces, refer to the API documentation.

            <title>Project evaluation</title>
            <para>You can receive a notification immediately before and after a project is evaluated. This can be used
                to do things like performing additional configuration once all the definitions in a build script have
                been applied, or for some custom logging or profiling.
            </para>
            <para>Below is an example which adds a <literal>test</literal> task to each project which has a
