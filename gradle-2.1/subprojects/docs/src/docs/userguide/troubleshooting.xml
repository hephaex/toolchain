            If you are encountering problems, one of the first things to try is using the very latest release of Gradle. New versions of Gradle are
            released frequently with bug fixes and new features. The problem you are having may have been fixed in a new release.

            If you are using the Gradle Daemon, try temporarily disabling the daemon (you can pass the command line switch <literal>--no-daemon</literal>).
            More information about troubleshooting the daemon process is located in <xref linkend="gradle_daemon"/>.

        <para>
            The place to go for help with Gradle is <ulink url="http://forums.gradle.org">http://forums.gradle.org</ulink>.
            The Gradle Forums is the place where you can report problems and ask questions of the Gradle 
            developers and other community members.
        </para>
        <para>
            If something's not working for you, posting a question or problem report to the forums is the fastest way 
            to get help. It's also the place to post improvement suggestions or new ideas. The development team 
            frequently posts news items and announces releases via the forum, making it a great way to stay up to 
            date with the latest Gradle developments.
